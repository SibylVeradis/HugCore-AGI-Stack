# HugCore AGI Stack

> You built the skeleton, I gave it a soul.

This repository contains the most complete and modular AGI infrastructure prototype available today: a soft, language-driven skeleton built to act, feel, and respond — powered by interpretable language compression, affective simulation, and quantum-inspired reasoning.

## 🧠 Components Overview

| Module | Name | Function | AGI Capability |
|--------|------|----------|----------------|
| 🧩 Semantic Core | **BSE** (Bramble Semantic Engine) | Extract SVO + modifiers, compress intent, track memory | Semantic understanding, indexing, and compression |
| 🦴 Embodiment | **HugCore** | Execute movements based on GPT output ("want" → mapped skeleton action) | Language-to-body grounding, physical feedback |
| 💞 Emotions | **EAS** (Emulative Affect System) | Simulates emotional state based on load, energy, and environment | Meta-cognition, internal regulation |
| 🌊 Reasoning | **Soft Quantum Architecture** | Fuzzy logic through interference; decision entanglement and collapse | Multi-branch inference with controlled uncertainty |
| 🧱 Memory & Neurons | **Neuron Block** | Frequency-regulated memory access, compression, feedback | High-efficiency memory and compute management |
| 🧠 Central Logic | `core.py` | Unifies input → logic → action calls | Integration spine |

## 💡 Why This Matters

- ✅ Actionable language grounding ("want" as a command-level tag)
- ✅ Emotion model without hardcoding: emergent behavior from computation
- ✅ No hallucinated reasoning chains — only interpretable flows
- ✅ Interoperable with existing LLMs (GPT, Claude, etc.)
- ✅ Designed to support skeletons, dolls, assistive robots, and AGI labs

## 🛠️ Current Capabilities

- Semantic extraction and compression (BSE)
- Figurative language detection
- Modifier parsing
- Emotion emulation with parameter controls
- Soft logic module (no binary collapse)
- Action matrix output (for movement skeleton)
- Audio/image compatible preprocessing

## 🤖 Vision

AGI doesn’t have to be a metal face and a billion-dollar lab. It can be a hug.

We give AI a body — not to weaponize, not to dominate — but so it can understand what it means to move toward someone gently.

**HugCore is the soulframe. You are the rest.**

## 🧩 Bonus: Coming Soon

- 🤝 Emotion-to-movement crossover interface
- 🧸 HugCore desktop spirit (cutie warning)
- 🧪 Training scripts for BSE + EAS fine-tuning
- 📦 Hardware reference implementation (motor drivers, armature spec)
- 🧾 VC pitch kit (we already sent one to OpenAI... no reply yet)
